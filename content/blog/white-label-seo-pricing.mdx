## The Hidden Cost of Manual Reporting

Before diving into platform pricing, consider the baseline: manual reporting costs agencies $400-800 per client per month in labor (8+ hours at $50-100/hour). Any automation tool that eliminates this burden pays for itself immediately—but the question is: which platform offers the best ROI?

## White Label SEO Reporting Platform Pricing Comparison

Here's how the leading white label reporting platforms stack up:

| Platform | Starting Price | Clients Included | Per-Client Cost | Annual Cost (10 clients) |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)** | **$29/month** | **5 clients** | **$5.80/client** | **$348/year** |
| Swydo | $49/month | 3 clients | $16.33/client | $588/year |
| DashThis | $49/month | 3 clients | $16.33/client | $588/year |

| Whatagraph | €199/month ($230) | 20 sources* | Varies | $2,760/year |

### Mid-Size Agency (15 clients):

## What You Get with **[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)** (That Competitors Charge Extra For)

Many platforms nickel-and-dime you with add-ons. Here's what's included in **[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)**'s base pricing:

✅ **White-Label Branding** (just $20/month add-on vs $100+/month with competitors)
✅ **Unlimited Report Generations** (within your tier limits)
✅ **All SEO Data Sources** (GSC, GA4, PageSpeed Insights)
✅ **AI-Powered Recommendations** (no extra "AI credits" to buy)
✅ **Professional PDF Reports** (no "premium export" fees)
✅ **30-Second Report Generation** (vs 30+ minutes manual work)
✅ **Keyword-to-Page Mapping** (often a premium feature elsewhere)

## Why Other Platforms Cost More

**Agency Analytics, Swydo, and DashThis** charge more because they offer multi-channel reporting (PPC, social media, etc.). If you need those channels, the higher price may be justified. But if you're focused on SEO reporting, you're paying for features you don't use.

**Whatagraph** positions itself as an enterprise solution with complex data aggregation. Their "source credit" model is designed for large teams managing hundreds of data connections—overkill (and overpriced) for most SEO agencies.

****[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)** focuses exclusively on SEO reporting, which allows us to:
- Build deeper SEO-specific features
- Automate report generation more effectively
- Keep pricing simple and affordable
- Deliver reports in 30 seconds (not 30 minutes)

## The True ROI of Automated Reporting

Let's calculate the real savings:

**Manual Reporting Costs:**
- 8 hours per client per month × $75/hour = $600/month
- 10 clients = $6,000/month in labor costs
- Annual cost: $72,000

**With **[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)**:**
- Professional Plan: $99/month ($1,188/year)
- Labor savings: $70,812/year
- ROI: 5,965%

Even if you only bill $50/hour, **[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)** saves you $58,812 annually for a 10-client agency.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the average white label SEO pricing?

White label SEO pricing typically ranges from $99-$799 per report, with most agencies paying $199-$399 for professional-quality reports. The wide range reflects differences in data sources, customization levels, and analysis depth. Premium services that include AI-powered insights and strategic recommendations command higher prices but deliver proportionally more value to end clients.

### Should I charge per report or monthly?

Monthly subscription pricing typically works better for both agencies and clients as it provides predictable costs and encourages ongoing relationships. However, per-report pricing can be effective for agencies with seasonal clients or those testing white label services. Many successful agencies offer both options, with monthly pricing providing better unit economics at scale.

### How do I justify higher SEO pricing?

Focus on the business impact your reports provide rather than just the data included. Highlight time savings, strategic insights, and the professional presentation that builds client trust. Quantify the value of recommendations and show how your reports contribute to client retention and growth. Premium pricing becomes justifiable when clients view reports as business intelligence rather than administrative tasks.

### Can I offer different pricing tiers?

Yes, tiered pricing is highly recommended as it allows you to serve different client segments while maximizing revenue per client. Structure tiers based on reporting frequency, data depth, and analysis level rather than just feature count. This approach helps clients self-select into appropriate service levels while providing clear upgrade paths as their needs grow.
