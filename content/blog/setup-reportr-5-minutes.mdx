# How to Set Up Reportr in Under 5 Minutes

Setting up professional SEO reporting shouldn't take hours of technical configuration. Most agencies waste an entire afternoon fumbling through API documentation, OAuth settings, and complex integrations just to generate their first report. With **[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)**, you can go from signup to your first branded SEO report in under 5 minutes – no technical skills required.

This guide walks you through the complete white label seo reports setup process, from creating your account to generating your first professional report. By the end of these 5 minutes, you'll have automated SEO reporting that pulls data from Google Search Console, Google Analytics 4, and PageSpeed Insights – all wrapped in your agency's branding.

## What You'll Need Before Starting

Before diving into the white label seo reports setup, make sure you have:

**Required Access**
- Google Search Console access to your client's website (Owner or Full User permission)
- Google Analytics 4 property connected to the site (Editor or Administrator role)
- Admin access to your agency's branding assets (logo, brand colors)

**Preparation Checklist**
- Client's domain verified in Google Search Console
- Your agency logo (PNG format, recommended 400x100px)
- Brand color hex code (e.g., #7e23ce)
- 5 minutes of uninterrupted time

Most agencies already have GSC and GA4 access for their clients. If you're missing access to a client's properties, request it before starting setup – this is the only potential blocker.

![Reportr Signup Page](/blog/images/setup-guide/01-signup-page.png "Reportr signup page showing Google OAuth integration")

## Step 1: Create Your Reportr Account

Getting started with **[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)** takes less than 60 seconds thanks to Google OAuth integration.

1. Visit **[reportr.agency/signup](/signup)**
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Select your Google account
4. Grant necessary permissions (GSC and GA4 access)

**Why Google OAuth?** This authentication method automatically connects your Google account, making client setup seamless later. You won't need to manually configure API keys, create developer projects, or manage credentials – everything happens automatically.

**Plan Selection:** Start with the FREE tier (1 client, 5 reports/month) to test the platform. You can upgrade anytime to: 
- STARTER ($29/month) 
- PROFESSIONAL ($99/month), or 
- AGENCY ($199/month). Check our **[pricing page](/pricing)** for detailed comparisons.

## Step 2: Set Up Your White Label Branding

Before adding clients, customize your agency branding so every report automatically includes your logo and colors.

![White Label Settings](/blog/images/setup-guide/02-white-label-settings.png "White label branding configuration screen")

Navigate to Settings → White Label Branding and configure:

**Upload Your Agency Logo**
1. Click "Upload Logo"
2. Select your PNG file (max 2MB)
3. Preview how it appears on reports
4. Save changes

**Logo Specifications:**
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Recommended size: 400x100 pixels
- Max file size: 2MB
- Displays in report cover

**Set Your Brand Colors**
1. Enter your primary brand color (hex code)
2. Preview how it affects report styling
3. **[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)** automatically generates complementary shades

Your brand color appears in report headers, charts, and accent elements throughout the PDF.

**Add Company Information**
- Agency name: Replaces "Reportr" throughout reports
- Website URL: Included in report footers
- Contact email: Optional, for client follow-ups

**White-Label Pricing:** Add white-label branding for $20/month on any plan. Without white-label, reports include a small "Powered by Reportr" badge – perfectly acceptable for testing, but upgrade before sending to paying clients.

Learn more about white-label options on our **[features page](/features)**.

## Step 3: Add Your First Client

Now comes the magic – connecting your client's data sources takes less than 2 minutes per client.

![Add Client Modal](/blog/images/setup-guide/03-add-client-modal.png "Add new client dialog with connection options")

From your dashboard, click "Add Client" and enter:
- Client name: How you'll identify them (e.g., "Acme Plumbing")
- Website domain: Their full domain (e.g., "acmeplumbing.com")
- Contact email: Optional, for your records

**Connect Google Search Console**

![Connect GSC and GA4](/blog/images/setup-guide/04-connect-gsc-and-ga4.png "Google Search Console and Analytics 4 connection screen")

1. Click "Connect Google Search Console"
2. Select the client's property from the dropdown
3. Grant permissions when prompted

**Important:** You must have "Owner" or "Full User" access to see the client's GSC property in the dropdown. If it's missing, log into Google Search Console and verify your access level first.

**What Reportr Pulls from GSC:**
- Total clicks and impressions
- Average click-through rate (CTR)
- Average position for all keywords
- Top 20 performing keywords with individual metrics
- Top 10 landing pages with traffic data
- 30-day trend charts showing daily performance

**Connect Google Analytics 4**

Still on the Add Client screen:
1. Click "Connect Google Analytics"
2. Select the client's GA4 property
3. Grant permissions

**Why Connect GA4?** While GSC shows search performance, GA4 reveals what happens after users land on the site. This includes organic sessions, user behavior, bounce rates, and conversion tracking – essential for comprehensive reporting.

**What Reportr Pulls from GA4:**
- Organic traffic sessions and users
- Bounce rate and engagement metrics
- Top organic landing pages
- Device breakdown (desktop/mobile/tablet)
- Traffic trends and period comparisons

**Connect PageSpeed Insights**

**[Reportr](https://reportr.agency)** automatically fetches PageSpeed Insights data for your client's website – no additional setup required. This includes:
- Mobile performance score (0-100)
- Desktop performance score (0-100)
- Core Web Vitals: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Top performance opportunities with estimated impact

This technical data helps identify speed issues affecting search rankings and user experience.

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Property not showing in dropdown | Verify GSC/GA4 access permissions |
| "Permission denied" error | Re-authenticate by clicking "Reconnect Google" |
| Multiple properties showing | Select the exact domain matching the website |
| No GA4 property available | GA4 is optional – reports work with GSC alone |
|---------|----------|


Click "Save Client" when all connections are complete.

## Step 4: Generate Your First Report

With your client connected, generating a professional report takes 30 seconds.

![Generate Report Step 1](/blog/images/setup-guide/05-generate-report-step-1.png "Report generation interface showing template options")
