DashThis has been a popular choice for agency reporting dashboards, but many SEO agencies are discovering that specialized tools often deliver better results for their specific needs. If you're evaluating a DashThis alternative for SEO reporting, this comprehensive comparison will help you understand why agencies are switching to more focused solutions.

The main challenge with general reporting platforms is that they try to cover every marketing channel but often lack the depth needed for professional SEO reporting. [**Reportr**](https://reportr.agency) takes a different approach—focusing specifically on SEO data to deliver professional, white-label reports that clients actually want to read.

In this detailed comparison, we'll examine setup complexity, reporting speed, SEO-specific features, pricing, and real-world use cases to help you choose the right reporting solution for your agency.

## Why Agencies Are Looking for DashThis Alternatives

DashThis built its reputation as a user-friendly dashboard builder that connects multiple data sources. However, several factors are driving agencies to seek specialized alternatives:

**Complexity vs. Focus**
While DashThis offers broad marketing dashboard capabilities, this versatility comes at a cost. Agencies report spending 1-2 hours setting up basic SEO dashboards, compared to the 5-minute setup time with dedicated SEO reporting tools.

**Limited SEO Depth**
General reporting platforms often treat SEO data as just another data source, lacking the contextual insights that SEO clients expect. Professional SEO reports need more than raw metrics—they require interpretation, trends analysis, and actionable recommendations.

**Template Limitations**
DashThis provides basic templates, but creating professional, client-ready SEO reports often requires extensive customization. Many agencies find themselves rebuilding the same elements repeatedly for each client.

**Pricing Structure**
As agencies grow, per-dashboard pricing models can become expensive quickly. When managing 20+ clients, the math starts favoring solutions with unlimited report generation.
