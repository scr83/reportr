1. Create account (2 minutes)

2. Connect Google Search Console and GA4 (3 minutes)

[Step-by-step setup guide](https://reportr.agency/blog/setup-reportr-5-minutes)

### 12. Do I need to give the tool access to my clients' Google accounts?

Yes, but it's secure and standard practice.

**How it works:**

1. Client authorizes via Google OAuth (standard Google security)

2. Tool receives "read-only" API access

3. Tool can pull data but cannot modify anything

4. Client can revoke access anytime from their Google account

**Security:**

- OAuth 2.0 standard (same as Gmail third-party apps)

- No passwords shared

- Read-only permissions

- Encrypted connections

### 13. What if my client doesn't want to share Google access?

You have two options:

**Option 1: Client gives you admin access**

- Client adds your email as GSC/GA4 admin

- You connect using your Google account

- You manage on their behalf

**Option 2: Export/import data manually**

- Client exports CSV from GSC/GA4

- You upload to white-label tool (if supported)

- Less automation, but maintains client control

**In practice:** 95% of clients have no issue with OAuth access once you explain it's read-only and secure.

### 14. Can I white-label reports for clients who don't have Google Analytics?

Yes, partially.

**What you can report without GA4:**

- Google Search Console data (keywords, clicks, impressions, positions)

- PageSpeed Insights (Core Web Vitals, performance scores)

**What you'll miss:**

- Session data

- Bounce rate

- Conversion tracking

- User behavior metrics

**Recommendation:** Help clients set up GA4. It takes 10 minutes and dramatically improves reporting value.

### 15. Do white-label tools work with other SEO platforms like Ahrefs or SEMrush?

It depends on the tool.

**Some tools integrate with:**

- Ahrefs API (backlink data, keyword rankings)

- SEMrush API (competitor analysis, keyword tracking)

- Screaming Frog (technical SEO data imports)

**[**Reportr**](https://reportr.agency) connects exclusively with Google APIs (Search Console, Analytics 4, PageSpeed Insights) for maximum accuracy and reliability. No third-party SEO tool integrations needed.**

## Branding & Customization Questions

### 16. How much can I customize the reports?

**Visual branding:**

- Upload your logo (header/footer)

- Set brand colors (primary, secondary, accents)

- Custom fonts (some tools)

- Remove all "Powered By" badges (included in paid plans)

**Content customization:**

- Choose report sections to include/exclude

- Reorder sections

- Add custom text/commentary

- Include/exclude specific metrics

**Advanced customization:**

- White-label domain (some tools)

- Custom email templates

- Branded dashboards

- API access for full control

### 17. Will my clients know I'm using reporting software?

Not if you use true white-label.

**What clients see:**

- Your agency logo

- Your brand colors

- Your company name

- Professional PDF with your design

**What clients don't see:**

- The software name

- "Powered By" badges

- Generic templates

- Any indication it's automated

**The goal:** Reports should look identical to ones you'd create manually.

### 18. Can I add my own commentary to automated reports?

Yes, all quality white-label tools support custom text.

**Where you can add commentary:**

- Executive summary section

- Individual metric sections

- Recommendations/action items

- Footer notes

**How it works:**

- Pre-set templates with your standard commentary

- Per-client custom notes

- Per-report unique insights

**Time investment:** 5-10 minutes to add custom commentary (still way faster than manual reporting).

### 19. Can I use my own domain for client dashboards?

Some white-label tools support custom domains. For example, [Agency Analytics](https://agencyanalytics.com/) offers custom domain options on their higher-tier plans.

**Example:**

- Default: `app.reportingtool.com/clients/acme-corp`

- Custom domain: `reports.youragency.com/acme-corp`

**Setup:**

- Point subdomain to the tool

- SSL certificate auto-generated

- Fully branded experience

**Note:** Not all tools offer this feature. Check before committing if this is critical.

### 20. What file formats can I export reports in?

**Standard formats:**

- PDF (most common, client-ready)

- Excel/CSV (for further analysis)

- Google Sheets (live data sync, some tools)

- PowerPoint/Slides (presentation format, some tools)

**[**Reportr**](https://reportr.agency) generates professional PDFs optimized for client delivery.**

## Data & Accuracy Questions

### 21. Is the data as accurate as manual reporting?

Yes—often more accurate.

**Why white-label tools are accurate:**

- Direct Google API connections (no manual data entry errors)

- Real-time data pulls

- Automated calculations (no math mistakes)

- Consistent formatting

**Why manual reporting has errors:**

- Copy-paste mistakes

- Calculation errors

- Outdated data (if delayed reporting)

- Inconsistent date ranges

**Bottom line:** Automation eliminates human error.

### 22. How fresh is the data in white-label reports?

**Google Search Console:**

- 2-3 day delay (Google's limitation, not the tool's)

- Data finalized after 3 days

**Google Analytics 4:**

- Near real-time (24-hour delay for complete data)

- Estimated data available within hours

**PageSpeed Insights:**

- Run on-demand when generating report

- Always current

**When you generate a report, the tool pulls the latest available data from Google.**

### 23. Can I customize date ranges for reports?

Yes.

**Common date range options:**

- Last 7 days

- Last 30 days

- Last 90 days

- Last 12 months

- Custom range (select specific start/end dates)

- Comparison periods (e.g., this month vs. last month)

**Best practice:** Use consistent date ranges for accurate month-over-month comparisons.

### 24. What happens if Google APIs go down?

**Rare but possible:**

**Short-term outage (hours):**

- Tool retries automatically

- Report generation delayed but completes

- No data loss

**Extended outage (days):**

- Generate reports once APIs recover

- Historical data unaffected

- Previous reports still accessible

**Your backup plan:**

- Download previous reports for client meetings

- Export raw CSV data from Google Search Console manually

- Communicate delay to clients (Google issue, not yours)

### 25. Can I schedule automatic report generation and delivery?

Yes, most white-label tools support scheduling.

**Automation options:**

- Monthly reports (auto-generate on 1st of month)

- Weekly reports (every Monday, for example)

- Custom schedules (bi-weekly, quarterly)

**Delivery options:**

- Auto-email to clients

- Download links sent to clients

- Save to Google Drive/Dropbox

- Post to client portals

**Note:** Feature availability varies by tool. Check if automated scheduling is critical for your workflow.
