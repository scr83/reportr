3. Problem-Aware (Pain Point): "how to automate SEO client reports"

Example:
"Manual SEO reporting is killing your agency's profitability. The average 
small agency spends 12-15 hours per month creating client reports‚Äîthat's 
nearly $1,200 in labor costs for a task that could be automated. In this

### Trust Signals Throughout Content

```markdown
**Social Proof Placement:**
- Introduction: "Join 200+ agencies using automated reporting"
- Mid-article: Pull quote testimonial from agency owner
- Before final CTA: "97% customer satisfaction rate"
- Sidebar: Live counter of reports generated today

**Risk Reversal:**
- "14-day free trial, no credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime, keep your data"

- "Integrates with Google Search Console, GA4, PageSpeed Insights"
- "Featured in [Industry Publication]"
- "SOC 2 Type II Certified" (when applicable)
```

### Writing Style & Tone Guidelines

```markdown
**Professional yet Approachable (Digital Frog Brand)**
- Write like an experienced agency owner talking to peers
- Confident but not arrogant
- Use "we" and "you" to create partnership tone
- Assume reader has SEO knowledge (don't explain basics)
- Use industry terminology naturally (GSC, DA, SERP, CRO)

**Results-Driven Language**
- Lead with outcomes, not features
- Use specific metrics and numbers
- Show ROI and time savings
- Example: "Save 8 hours per week" vs "Automated workflow"

**Conversational but Credible**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Varied sentence structure
- Rhetorical questions to engage reader
- Personal pronouns (I, you, we)
- Contractions are fine (don't, you'll, we're)

**Data-Backed Claims**
- Always cite sources for statistics
- Use our own data when possible ("Our users report...")
- Link to authority sources (Moz, Ahrefs blog, Google)
- Avoid vague claims ("many agencies", "most people")
```

### Example Writing Styles

```markdown
‚ùå **BAD - Too Feature-Focused:**
"Reportr is a SaaS tool that has white-label capabilities and integrates 
with Google Search Console. It has a dashboard where you can see metrics."

‚úÖ **GOOD - Outcome-Focused:**
"Stop wasting 8 hours every week on manual SEO reports. Reportr automatically 
pulls data from Google Search Console, GA4, and PageSpeed Insights, then 
generates a professional, white-labeled PDF report in 30 seconds. 
One agency owner told us: 'I got my weekends back.'"

---

‚ùå **BAD - Generic and Vague:**
"Many agencies struggle with reporting. It can be time-consuming and difficult."

‚úÖ **GOOD - Specific and Data-Driven:**
"The average small agency spends 12-15 hours per month on client SEO reporting. 
For a 10-client roster, that's 120-150 hours annually‚Äîalmost a full month 
of work. At $100/hour, you're burning $12,000-15,000 in labor on a task 
that could be automated."

---

‚ùå **BAD - Weak CTA:**
"If you're interested, you can try our tool."

‚úÖ **GOOD - Strong CTA:**
"Ready to reclaim those 8 hours? Start your free 14-day trial now‚Äîno credit 
card required. Setup takes 5 minutes, and you'll generate your first 
white-label report in 30 seconds."
```
