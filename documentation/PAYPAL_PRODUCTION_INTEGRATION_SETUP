üèóÔ∏è Architecture
PayPal Client Implementation
File: src/lib/services/paypal-client.ts
typescriptconst PAYPAL_API_BASE = process.env.PAYPAL_MODE === 'live' 
  ? 'https://api-m.paypal.com'
  : 'https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com';

export class PayPalClient {
  private clientId: string;
  private clientSecret: string;
  private baseUrl: string;

  constructor() {
    this.clientId = process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID!;
    this.clientSecret = process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET!;
    this.baseUrl = PAYPAL_API_BASE;
  }

  async getAccessToken(): Promise<string> { /* ... */ }
  async createSubscription(planId, returnUrl, cancelUrl): Promise<CreateSubscriptionResponse> { /* ... */ }
  async getSubscriptionDetails(subscriptionId): Promise<SubscriptionDetails> { /* ... */ }
  async cancelSubscription(subscriptionId, reason): Promise<void> { /* ... */ }
}
API Route
File: src/app/api/payments/create-subscription/route.ts
Key Features:

Runtime: nodejs (required for Prisma Accelerate compatibility)
Duplicate subscription prevention
User authentication check
PayPal subscription creation
Approval URL extraction

typescriptexport const runtime = 'nodejs' // CRITICAL: Required for database connectivity

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // 1. Authentication check
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  
  // 2. Duplicate subscription prevention
  const existingUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({...});
  
  // 3. Create PayPal subscription
  const subscription = await paypalClient.createSubscription(
    planId,
    returnUrl,
    cancelUrl
  );
  
  // 4. Return approval URL
  return NextResponse.json({
    subscriptionId: subscription.id,
    approvalUrl: approvalUrl,
  });
}

üêõ Troubleshooting Journey
Issue #1: Database Connection Errors (P6008)
Error: Prisma Accelerate was not able to connect to your database
Root Cause: API route defaulted to Vercel Edge Runtime, which is incompatible with Prisma Accelerate connection pooling.
Solution: Added export const runtime = 'nodejs' to force Node.js runtime.
Files Modified:

src/app/api/payments/create-subscription/route.ts


Issue #2: INVALID_RESOURCE_ID Error
Error: The specified resource does not exist (404 from PayPal API)
Root Cause: Subscription plan was created in Production PayPal environment, but application was configured to use Sandbox PayPal credentials.
Key Learning: PayPal has completely separate environments:

Sandbox: api-m.sandbox.paypal.com (for testing)
Production: api-m.paypal.com (for real transactions)

Plans created in one environment DO NOT exist in the other.
Solution: Created production PayPal app and switched to live credentials.

Issue #3: Environment Mismatch
Problem: Plan visible in PayPal Business Dashboard but API returned "not found"
Explanation:

PayPal Business Dashboard (paypal.com) = Production
PayPal Developer Sandbox (sandbox.paypal.com) = Separate test environment
Plans must be created in the same environment as your API credentials

Solution: Verified plan exists in production, updated app to use production credentials.

üîÑ Migration Path: Sandbox ‚Üí Production
Why We Switched
Initially configured for sandbox testing, but:

Plan was accidentally created in production
Easier to switch to production than recreate plan in sandbox
Application ready for real transactions

Steps Taken

Created Live PayPal App

Dashboard: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/
Toggle: Sandbox ‚Üí Live
Created "Reportr" app
Generated production credentials


Updated Environment Variables

Changed PAYPAL_MODE from sandbox to live
Updated PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID with production credentials
Updated PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET with production credentials
Kept existing PAYPAL_STARTER_PLAN_ID (already production)


Deployed Changes

Updated .env.local locally
Updated Vercel environment variables
Triggered redeploy




‚úÖ Testing Checklist
Pre-Deployment Verification

 PayPal app created in correct environment (Live)
 Subscription plan exists and is active
 Environment variables set in Vercel (all environments)
 .env.local updated with production credentials
 PAYPAL_MODE set to live
 Runtime specification (nodejs) present in API route

Post-Deployment Testing

 Navigate to pricing page
 Click subscribe button
 Authenticate with Google OAuth
 Redirect to PayPal (verify URL is www.paypal.com, not sandbox.paypal.com)
 PayPal shows correct plan ($39/month)
 Complete subscription with test account
 Verify redirect to success page
 Check database for subscription record
 Verify subscription appears in PayPal dashboard
 Test cancellation flow (if implemented)


üö® Critical Configuration Points
1. Runtime Specification
Always use Node.js runtime for database-enabled routes:
typescriptexport const runtime = 'nodejs'
Why: Prisma Accelerate requires Node.js runtime. Edge Runtime causes P6008 connection errors.
2. Environment Consistency
Ensure all components use the same environment:

Credentials from Live app ‚Üí Plans from Production PayPal
Credentials from Sandbox app ‚Üí Plans from Sandbox PayPal

Never mix environments!
3. PayPal API Base URL
Automatically determined by PAYPAL_MODE variable:
typescriptconst PAYPAL_API_BASE = process.env.PAYPAL_MODE === 'live' 
  ? 'https://api-m.paypal.com'
  : 'https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com';
4. Return URLs
Must match your deployment domain:
typescriptconst baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3001';
const returnUrl = `${baseUrl}/payment/success?session_id=${session.user.id}`;
const cancelUrl = `${baseUrl}/payment/canceled`;

üìä Database Schema
User Model (Prisma)
prismamodel User {
  id                    String   @id @default(cuid())
  email                 String   @unique
  paypalSubscriptionId  String?
  subscriptionStatus    String?
  plan                  String?
  // ... other fields
}
Subscription-Related Fields:

paypalSubscriptionId: PayPal subscription ID (format: I-XXXXX)
subscriptionStatus: Current status (active, canceled, pending, etc.)
plan: Plan tier (starter, professional, enterprise)


üîê Security Considerations
Environment Variables

Never commit .env.local to git
Verify .env.local is in .gitignore
Rotate secrets regularly in production
Use separate credentials for development/staging/production

PayPal Webhooks
Recommended: Set up webhooks to handle:

Subscription activated
Subscription canceled
Payment completed
Payment failed

Webhook URL: https://reportr-one.vercel.app/api/payments/webhook
Rate Limiting
PayPal API has rate limits. Consider implementing:

Request throttling
Retry logic with exponential backoff
Caching for access tokens (valid for 9 hours)

üéØ Common Issues & Solutions
Issue: "Unauthorized" Error
Symptoms: 401 error when calling PayPal API
Causes:

Invalid Client ID or Secret
Credentials from wrong environment (sandbox vs live)
Expired access token

Solution:

Verify credentials match your environment
Check PAYPAL_MODE is set correctly
Regenerate credentials if needed


Issue: "INVALID_RESOURCE_ID" Error
Symptoms: 404 error, "The specified resource does not exist"
Causes:

Plan ID doesn't exist in current environment
Typo in Plan ID
Plan is inactive or deleted

Solution:

Verify plan exists in PayPal dashboard
Check plan status is "Active"
Ensure environment consistency (sandbox vs live)
Create new plan if needed


Issue: Database Connection Timeout
Symptoms: P6008 error, "Accelerate was not able to connect to your database"
Causes:

Missing runtime = 'nodejs' specification
Edge Runtime incompatibility with Prisma Accelerate
Database connection issues

Solution:

Add export const runtime = 'nodejs' to API route
Verify Prisma Accelerate is configured correctly
Check database connection string


Issue: Redirect Loop or No Redirect
Symptoms: After PayPal approval, doesn't redirect back
Causes:

Invalid return URL
Return URL not whitelisted in PayPal app settings
Frontend not handling redirect properly

Solution:

Verify return URL in subscription creation request
Add return URL to PayPal app settings
Check browser console for errors


üìà Future Enhancements
Webhook Implementation
Priority: High
Currently missing webhook handling for:

Subscription activation confirmation
Payment failure notifications
Subscription cancellation events
Billing cycle updates

Implementation:

Create /api/payments/webhook endpoint
Verify webhook signatures
Update database based on events
Send user notifications


Multiple Plan Support
Priority: Medium
Current setup supports one plan. Extend to support:

Professional Plan ($99/month)
Enterprise Plan ($299/month)
Annual billing options (10% discount)

Changes Needed:

Add plan IDs to environment variables
Update frontend to pass correct plan ID
Implement plan upgrade/downgrade logic


Subscription Management UI
Priority: Medium
Add user-facing subscription management:

View current plan details
Upgrade/downgrade plans
Cancel subscription
View payment history
Update payment method


Analytics & Monitoring
Priority: Low
Implement tracking for:

Subscription conversion rates
Churn analysis
Revenue metrics
Failed payment recovery


üéì Key Learnings
1. Environment Separation is Critical
PayPal's sandbox and production are completely separate. Resources (plans, subscriptions) created in one environment don't exist in the other.
2. Runtime Matters for Serverless
Vercel's Edge Runtime has limitations. Database-heavy operations require Node.js runtime specification.
3. Error Messages Can Be Misleading
"Database connection error" was masking the real issue: PayPal environment mismatch. Always check logs at every integration point.
4. Test Environments Have Limitations
Sometimes it's more practical to test in production (carefully!) than trying to replicate complex sandbox setups.
5. Documentation is Essential
Complex integrations with multiple failure points require comprehensive documentation for troubleshooting and onboarding.
