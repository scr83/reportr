  ↓ Session established

Step 4: Add Your First Client (/onboarding/add-client) ← NEW!
  ✓ User IS authenticated
  ✓ Optional with "Skip for Now" button
  ✓ Save client info to localStorage
  ↓

Step 5: Complete Setup (/onboarding/complete)

## 🔒 Tier Limits Implementation

### Database Schema
```prisma
enum Plan {
  FREE
  STARTER
  PROFESSIONAL
  ENTERPRISE
}

model User {
  plan Plan @default(FREE)
  // ... other fields
}
```

### API Enforcement (`/api/clients` POST)

```typescript
// Check tier limits before creating client
const clientCount = await prisma.client.count({
  where: { userId: user.id }
});

// FREE: 1 client max
if (user.plan === 'FREE' && clientCount >= 1) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Client limit reached',
    message: 'FREE plan allows 1 client. Upgrade to add more clients.',
    upgrade: true
  }, { status: 403 });
}

// STARTER: 5 clients max
if (user.plan === 'STARTER' && clientCount >= 5) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Client limit reached',
    message: 'STARTER plan allows 5 clients. Upgrade to PROFESSIONAL for 15 clients.',
    upgrade: true
  }, { status: 403 });
}

// PROFESSIONAL: 15 clients max
if (user.plan === 'PROFESSIONAL' && clientCount >= 15) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Client limit reached',
    message: 'PROFESSIONAL plan allows 15 clients. Upgrade to ENTERPRISE for 50 clients.',
    upgrade: true
  }, { status: 403 });
}

// ENTERPRISE: 50 clients max
if (user.plan === 'ENTERPRISE' && clientCount >= 50) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Client limit reached',
    message: 'ENTERPRISE plan allows 50 clients. Contact us for custom pricing.',
    upgrade: true
  }, { status: 403 });
}
```

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": "Client limit reached",
  "message": "FREE plan allows 1 client. Upgrade to add more clients.",
  "upgrade": true
}
```

## 💻 Code Highlights

### Add Client Page - Form Submission
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  
  try {
    // Save to localStorage (NOT database yet)
    localStorage.setItem('firstClient', JSON.stringify({
      name: formData.name,
      domain: formData.domain,
      contactEmail: formData.contactEmail || undefined,
    }))

    // Continue to completion page
    router.push('/onboarding/complete')
  } catch (error) {
    setError('Failed to save client information')
  }
}
```

### Completion Page - Client Creation
```typescript
// Get saved client data
const clientData = localStorage.getItem('firstClient')

if (clientData) {
  setStep('Adding your first client...')
  const client = JSON.parse(clientData)
  
  // NOW create in database (user is authenticated)
  const response = await fetch('/api/clients', {
    method: 'POST',
    credentials: 'include',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: client.name,
      domain: client.domain,
      contactEmail: client.contactEmail,
    }),
  })
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to create client')
  }
}

// Clear localStorage
localStorage.removeItem('firstClient')
```

## 📚 Technical Decisions

### Why localStorage Instead of Direct API Call?

**Decision:** Save client info to localStorage in Step 4, create in database in Step 5

**Rationale:**
1. **Consistency:** Same pattern as agency setup (Steps 1-2)
2. **Rollback:** Easy to abort if completion fails
3. **Clean Separation:** All database writes happen in one place (Step 5)
4. **Error Handling:** Simpler to handle failures
5. **User Experience:** Faster perceived performance

### Why Optional Instead of Required?

**Decision:** Allow users to skip adding a client

**Rationale:**
1. **Flexibility:** Some users want to explore first
2. **Less Friction:** Don't force decisions
3. **Testing:** Users can test app without real client data
4. **Conversion:** Can add client anytime from dashboard
5. **Industry Standard:** Most SaaS apps allow skipping onboarding steps

### Why Show Tier Limits in Onboarding?

**Decision:** Display "FREE Plan: 1 client, 5 reports" prominently

**Rationale:**
1. **Transparency:** Users know what they're getting
2. **Expectations:** No surprises when hitting limits
3. **Upgrades:** Plant seed for future upgrade
4. **Trust:** Honest about limitations
5. **Conversion:** Actually increases paid conversion (users see value)
