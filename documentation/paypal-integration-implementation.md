```prisma
paypalSubscriptionId String?   @unique
subscriptionStatus   String    @default("free")
paypalCustomerId     String?   @unique
payments             Payment[]
```

New Payment model:
```prisma
model Payment {
  id                   String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId               String
  paypalOrderId        String   @unique
  paypalSubscriptionId String?
  amount               Decimal  @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  currency             String   @default("USD")
  status               String
  plan                 Plan
  metadata             Json?
  createdAt            DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt            DateTime @updatedAt
  
  @@index([userId])

## Integration Flow Diagram

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SUBSCRIPTION FLOW                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. User Journey - Initial Subscription
   User (Landing Page)
     ↓ Clicks "Subscribe Now"
   PayPalSubscribeButton
     ↓ POST /api/payments/create-subscription
   Backend
     ↓ Creates subscription with PayPal
   PayPal API
     ↓ Returns approval URL
   User Redirected to PayPal
     ↓ Approves payment
   PayPal Redirects to /payment/success?subscription_id=XXX
     ↓ POST /api/payments/activate-subscription
   Backend Updates User
     ↓ plan=STARTER, subscriptionStatus=active, billingCycleStart=now
   Redirects to /dashboard
     ↓
   Subscription Active ✅

2. Monthly Renewal Flow
   30 Days Later
     ↓ PayPal charges $39
   PayPal Sends Webhook
     ↓ POST /api/payments/webhook (PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED)
   Backend Handles Event
     ↓ Resets billingCycleStart/End
     ↓ Creates Payment record
   User Access Continues ✅

3. Cancellation Flow
   User (Dashboard Settings)
     ↓ Clicks "Cancel Subscription"
   Frontend
     ↓ POST /api/payments/cancel-subscription
   Backend
     ↓ Calls PayPal cancel API
     ↓ Updates subscriptionStatus=canceled
   Access Until Period Ends
     ↓ At billingCycleEnd
   Auto-Downgrade to FREE ✅
```

---

## Subscription Lifecycle States

```typescript
subscriptionStatus Values:

"free"      → User on FREE plan (no subscription)
"trial"     → User in 14-day trial (existing system)
"active"    → Paid subscription, current billing cycle
"past_due"  → Payment failed, grace period active
"canceled"  → User canceled, access until period ends
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Sandbox Testing (Before Production)

**Test Accounts:**
- Sandbox Business: scontrerasr@gmail.com (already set up)
- Sandbox Buyer: Use PayPal-provided test accounts

**Test Cases:**
1. ✅ Create subscription flow (Landing → PayPal → Success → Dashboard)
2. ✅ Payment cancellation flow
3. ⚠️ Webhook delivery (simulate via PayPal Developer Dashboard)
4. ⚠️ Failed payment handling
5. ⚠️ Duplicate subscription prevention
6. ⚠️ Trial-to-paid conversion

### Production Testing (After Go-Live)

**Pre-Launch:**
1. Switch to PayPal Live mode
2. Create Live PayPal app and plan
3. Update environment variables
4. Test with real $1 transaction

**Post-Launch Monitoring:**
- Webhook delivery success rate
- Payment success/failure rates
- Subscription activation time
- User churn after failed payments

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue: Subscription creation fails**
- Check PayPal credentials are correct
- Verify PAYPAL_MODE matches environment
- Check Plan ID is valid
- Look for errors in server logs

**Issue: Webhook not received**
- Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible
- Check webhook is registered in PayPal Dashboard
- Confirm webhook events are subscribed
- Check server logs for incoming requests

**Issue: Activation fails after PayPal approval**
- Check subscription_id in URL
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check database connection
- Look for errors in activate-subscription logs

**Issue: User charged but not upgraded**
- Check webhook was received
- Verify user subscriptionStatus updated
- Check Payment record created
- Manually run activation if needed

### Debug Checklist
1. Check server logs (console.log outputs)
2. Verify PayPal Developer Dashboard for webhook events
3. Check database records (User + Payment tables)
4. Test API endpoints directly with Postman
5. Verify environment variables are loaded

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Vulnerabilities (To Fix)
1. **Webhook Spoofing** - No signature verification (CRITICAL)
2. **Rate Limiting** - Payment endpoints unprotected
3. **Input Validation** - Webhook payloads not validated

### Security Best Practices
- Keep PayPal credentials in environment variables only
- Never commit secrets to git
- Use HTTPS for all PayPal communication
- Implement webhook signature verification
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Log all payment operations for audit trail

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Cache PayPal OAuth tokens** (currently fetched per request)
2. **Batch webhook processing** (if high volume)
3. **Database indexes** (already implemented)
4. **Async payment record creation** (non-blocking)

### Scaling Strategy
- PayPal API rate limits: 10,000 requests/hour
- Database can handle 1000s of subscriptions
- Webhook endpoint should handle bursts
- Consider Redis for token caching at scale

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring Requirements
- Track subscription creation success rate
- Monitor webhook delivery failures
- Alert on payment failures
- Track churn rate after failed payments

### Regular Maintenance
- Review failed payment logs weekly
- Clean up orphaned subscriptions monthly
- Update PayPal API client when new features available
- Test webhook delivery quarterly

## Known Limitations

1. **Sandbox Mode Only** - Currently testing, not accepting real payments
2. **STARTER Plan Only** - Other tiers (PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE) not implemented
3. **No Prorated Refunds** - Cancellation keeps access until period ends
4. **Single Currency** - USD only, no multi-currency support
5. **No Plan Changes** - Can't upgrade/downgrade between plans yet

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
1. Add PROFESSIONAL and ENTERPRISE plan support
2. Implement plan upgrade/downgrade flows
3. Add prorated billing for mid-cycle changes
4. Create subscription management dashboard
5. Add payment method update functionality

### Phase 3 Features
1. Multi-currency support
2. Annual billing with discount
3. Usage-based overages
4. Team/multi-user subscriptions
