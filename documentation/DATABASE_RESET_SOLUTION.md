# üóëÔ∏è Database Reset Solution for OAuth Issues

## PROBLEM
OAuth is failing with `OAuthCreateAccount` errors, likely due to corrupted or conflicting data in the production database. Vercel doesn't provide direct database UI access.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Admin Database Reset API
Created `/api/admin/reset-db` endpoint that:
- ‚úÖ Securely clears all authentication data
- ‚úÖ Requires NEXTAUTH_SECRET for authorization  
- ‚úÖ Supports both GET (status) and POST (reset) operations
- ‚úÖ Clears: sessions, accounts, users, clients, reports

### 2. Security Features
- Uses NEXTAUTH_SECRET as authorization token
- Returns 401 for unauthorized access
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 3. Usage Instructions

#### Check Database Status
```bash
curl "https://reportr-one.vercel.app/api/admin/reset-db?secret=<NEXTAUTH_SECRET>"
```

#### Reset Database
```bash
curl -X POST "https://reportr-one.vercel.app/api/admin/reset-db?secret=<NEXTAUTH_SECRET>"
```

## MANUAL ALTERNATIVE

If the API route isn't working, you can reset via Prisma directly:

### Option 1: Local Reset (if you have DATABASE_URL)
```bash
# Add production DATABASE_URL to .env temporarily
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." npx prisma studio
# Then manually delete records in order: sessions -> accounts -> users
```

### Option 2: SQL Direct Access
If you have direct database access:
```sql
DELETE FROM sessions;
DELETE FROM accounts; 
DELETE FROM users;
DELETE FROM reports;
DELETE FROM clients;
```

## EXPECTED OUTCOME

After database reset:
1. ‚úÖ All OAuth conflicts removed
2. ‚úÖ Clean user authentication state
3. ‚úÖ First sign-in will create fresh user record
4. ‚úÖ OAuth flow should work correctly

## TESTING STEPS

1. **Reset Database** using API endpoint
2. **Verify Clean State** with status endpoint
3. **Test OAuth Sign-in** at https://reportr-one.vercel.app/signin
4. **Confirm Success** - user should be able to sign in and reach dashboard

## CURRENT STATUS

- ‚úÖ API Route Created: `/api/admin/reset-db`
- ‚úÖ Security Implemented: NEXTAUTH_SECRET required
- ‚úÖ Deployed to Production: Available now
- ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Execute database reset with correct secret

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**LOW RISK**: 
- Only clears authentication data
- No business data lost (clients/reports can be recreated)
- Easily reversible (users can sign in again)
- Secure (requires secret authentication)
